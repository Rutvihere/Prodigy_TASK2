Roller Coaster Dataset Analysis
Welcome to the Roller Coaster Dataset Analysis repository!
This project focuses on conducting Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a roller coaster dataset to uncover valuable insights and trends.

Objective
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the roller coaster dataset, explore its structure,
and identify patterns and relationships between variables through data visualization and statistical analysis.

Overview
In this analysis, we followed a systematic approach to understand the roller coaster dataset:

Data Collection: The dataset was obtained and imported into Python using pandas.

Data Cleaning: Preprocessing steps were applied to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and format data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Various visualization techniques, including bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps, 
                           were utilized to explore the dataset's characteristics and relationships between variables.

Insights and Findings: Key findings and insights derived from the analysis were documented to gain a deeper understanding of the roller coaster dataset.

Finally analysed the data set and got the required structural information from the dataset
